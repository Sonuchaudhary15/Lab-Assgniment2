This lab assignment was completed to practice the basic concepts of **HTML structure** and **CSS selectors**.  
The task was to create a **Student Profile Web Page** using only HTML and an external CSS file. The main focus of this lab was to understand how different CSS selectors work and how semantic HTML elements are used to organize a webpage.

Advanced CSS features and JavaScript were not used, as they were outside the scope of this lab.
